# ladder-naming-convention-script
a PERL script written to automatically format files to a naming convention. Written specially and with care for @gatowag


place the script (ladder.pl) in the directory. By default the subject file to rename will be format.mp4

once you place format.mp4 in the directory run the script and enter the episode name. You can edit the show name in within the script itself
The settings are front and center so they should be easy to change.
To change the current episode number look in iter.txt
you only need to change this once because it auto increments everytime it runs
